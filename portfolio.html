                <p class="aboutmeinfo">Pleased you could make it! The names Joshua. I was born and raised in the great state of Arizona, so I'm a master of the heat. I'm currently residing in Phoenix. I am currently a parts manager at an autobody shop. Hoping to get into the tech industry after my web development bootcamp at UofA. I have two high energy boxer mixes, so I walk them often, take them on hikes when I can. A few hobbies I enjoy are hiking, archery, binge watch shows, working on my car. I am a car enthusiast and one day will build my own race car. I look forward to learning and experiencing new things in the computer world and hope to bring my personality and smarts to a company to grow with. </p>
